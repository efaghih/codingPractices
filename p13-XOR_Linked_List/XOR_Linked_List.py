# This problem was asked by Google.

# An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of 
# each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is 
# an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; 
# it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which
#  returns the node at index.

# If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), 
# you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions 
# that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

# Example usage:
xor_list = XORLinkedList()
xor_list.add(10)
xor_list.add(20)
xor_list.add(30)
xor_list.add(40)

print(xor_list.get(0))  # 10
print(xor_list.get(2))  # 30
